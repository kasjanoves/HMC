<h2> Home Media Catalog </h2>

Study project of Java web-application (actually my first java project) 

This project served as a way for me to gain hands-on experience with Java and fundamental technologies like Servlets, JDBC etc.

Crucial features:
- downloading media/image files into database or file system
- adding, editing description
- supporting tags
- flexible search by tags/description
- search by metadata
- gallery and detailed view

 Used technologies: Java8, Servlets, JSP, JDBC, JSTL, MySQL, Tomcat
 
 Third-side libraries: drewnoakes, mp4parser, jcodec

 Unfortunately, I wasn't able to complete the project due to time constraints from my first position as a Java junior developer.
